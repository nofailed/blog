## Challenge for being a police officer #2

Continuing from the last diary about my challenge for becoming a police officer, I passed the practical test of the certificate. This means that eventually, I'm qualified to apply for the job posting of a police officer. Though qualified with the EIP certificate, I also needed to take more tests to get extra points which will be helpful for the competition of career recruitment because I had nothing to get the additional points until that time.

Unfortunately, it's really late time to get extra points by acquiring professional qualifications. Considering the remaining time given to me, everything was urgent and finding proper tests and applying for them were also hard at the moment because generally, almost every test receives the application forms certain months early. Anyway, to get all the extra points, I had to get 3 more professional qualifications. Getting to know that it takes short time to get a license for the bus, I applied for the test right away. Even the driving academy requiring a little much money, it was worth applying. This made me be busy getting training the next week. At the same time, I applied TOEIC and the Use of Computer test.

I was studying the written test for becoming a police officer with preparing all the others I'd applied to get extra points.

Can you imagine how much I was busy? But I couldn't help trying them for my new challenge. Frankly speaking, I had a hard time ever preparing them. I already spent too much time doing them but my journey not yet finished. Things that I've mentioned before are almost done. I'd took every test and achieved the test results that I expected except the test result for Use of Computer which will be revealed next week.

I already embarked on the next phase for preparing for the physical test.

To be continued.
