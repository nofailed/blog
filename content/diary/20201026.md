Very frustrating day today is. I made a big mistake today. Everything I had been doing became a nothing today. Yesterday I took a train to go to my mother's house in Daegu to stay a night because I had to take a physical ability test to become a police officer at Daegu.

The test consisted of two kinds of running. The first one was a 100-meter run and the second was a 1-kilometer run. Almost every second day I have been training running. Moreover, I had to watch my weight to get better scores on the test.

Personally speaking, I used to attend marathon competitions every year more than twice, even though I had backed out of the race this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. So I was confident in the 1-kilometer run. For this reason, my training program was focused on the 100-meter run. Even Feeling tired, I tried to keep the practice.
And these kinds of effort was continued till this morning. To avoid stomachache which may come suddenly during the test, I even considered today's breakfast. What I prepared for the morning meal was banana, chocolate and sweet coffee which is caffeinated highly. From what I have investigated, consumption of caffeine can increase energy productivity by stimulating the central nervous system.

And it all went down the drain because of my carelessness.

Everything seemed going sweetly and according to plan. I got up early this morning and ate what I prepared and arrived at the testing place 30 minutes early. Visiting the restroom before getting there, I felt lighter. I was waiting the examiners would say my name but never happened. I didn't know until that time that they already checked attendance. I was the only absent on the day and this meant that I'm already failed the test.

I realized that I was wrong about the gathering time and there was no consideration for the late. the examiner spoke with heavy irony, "get out of here".
