## Disasters

### Introduction

Every year, millions of people are affected by both human-caused and natural disasters. Disasters may be explosions, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornados, or fires. In a disaster, you face the danger of death or physical injury. You may also lose your home, possessions, and community. Such stressors place you at risk for emotional and physical health problems.

Disasters are routinely divided into natural or human-made, although complex disasters, where there is no single root cause, are more common in developing countries. A specific disaster may spawn a secondary disaster that increases the impact. A classic example is an earthquake that causes a tsunami, resulting in coastal flooding. Some manufactured disasters have been ascribed to nature.

Some researchers also differentiate between recurring events such as seasonal flooding, and those considered unpredictable.

As time goes by and industrialization progresses, the boundaries between the two seem to be blurred.

### Naturan disasters

A natural disaster is a natural process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.

Various phenomena like earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, tsunamis, cyclones and pandemics are all natural hazards that kill thousands of people and destroy billions of dollars of habitat and property each year. However, the rapid growth of the world's population and its increased concentration often in hazardous environments has escalated both the frequency and severity of disasters. With the tropical climate and unstable landforms, coupled with deforestation, unplanned growth proliferation, non-engineered constructions make the disaster-prone areas more vulnerable. Developing countries suffer more or less chronically from natural disasters due to ineffective communication combined with insufficient budgetary allocation for disaster prevention and management.

### Human-made disasters

Human-instigated disasters are the consequence of technological or human hazards. Examples include fires, transport accidents, industrial accidents, oil spills, terrorist attacks, nuclear explosions, nuclear radiation. War and deliberate attacks may also be put in this category.

Other types of induced disasters include the more cosmic scenarios of catastrophic global warming, nuclear war, and bioterrorism.

One opinion argues that all disasters can be seen as human-made, due to human failure to introduce appropriate emergency management measures.

### Conclusion

A natural disaster can occur at any time. Some disasters give a warning, such as a storm preceding a flood. Others, such as earthquakes, give little or no warning. Once a disaster happens, the time to prepare is gone.

The best way to cope with a natural disaster is to prepare by having a plan before it strikes.

Disasters vary in size, from smaller events such as a storm affecting a single suburb, to large-scale events that can affect whole cities or large areas that cross state boundaries.

As a result of disasters, people may be injured or killed, or may lose their homes and valuable possessions.

It is important to protect people, home, business and assets from such events. 

Taking steps to prepare for a disaster can help get you back to normal faster. If you are unprepared, the devastation and financial loss caused by natural disasters can be magnified.
