I don't think watching TV is not that educational. It requires no effort, and people don't have to exercise their imagination, because TV swiftly shows what comes next. People become stereotyped and uniform. However, some programs, documentaries for example, give opportunities to explore new worlds, broadening our experience and giving us the chance to think.

A lot of people in modern society are hooked on TV. The idiot box has become a "third parent" to our children and a "second spouse" to our wives and husbands. Indeed, in some homes the children, and individually the parents, spend more time with the television than each other. Critics worry that passively watching TV is to absorbing of our time and attention. We not only do not get enough phsical exercise, but we do not stimulate our mental activity either.

Another problem is the tendency toward copycat behavior. We dress, talk, and behave in ways that we model after characters on TV and in the movies. This is especially worrisome since so many of these programs are excessively violent and sexually suggestive. Many legal experts believe that delinquency problems are made much worse by young people imitating what they see in the media.

Some steps need to be take. First parents need to do a better job of policing their TV sets, not only in terms of what their children watch but also how much time they spend doing it. Second, parents and teachers must educate kids to develop a more conscious, critical attitude toward what they watch, instead of just absorbing it all like a sponge. Lastly, if you spend too much time for watching TV or watch TV aimlessly, you have to change your TV viewing habits first. Our children are mirrors, reflecting images of what happens around them. Leading by example how to watch TV beneficially would be the best practice and education for their kids.
