# Introduction

Have you ever heard about SKY castle, the K-Drama which has had got tons of popularity? But despite its popularity, I didn't watch it yet. But I already know the main story of that through being exposed by others. And also many TV shows dealing with these kinds of content have received tremendous attention from people, especially from parents.

No one are more interested in their children's education than Korean parents. No other parents in the world are as interested in their children's education as Korean parents. Korean parents are more interested in their children's education than all the parents in the world. Korean parents are more interested in their children's education than any other parents in the world. Korean parents are the most interested in their children's education in the world. They even have a saying that their basic attitude: "no learn, no food." As a result, most Korean parents are willing to sacrifice their own enjoyment and comfort in behalf of their kids educational opportunities. Many experts regard this passion for schooling as the basis for the strong economic development of the last few decades.

Most Koreans continue to believe that a college degree is the `license` needed to enter high society. I'm one of them. In my guess, the investment of their kids to the schooling may not be the best but it could be an easy and safe way to lead their life into at least guaranteed. These comments may sound like an excuse to be indifferent. But there's no doubt that it works.

Recent developments have highlighted this basic tendency, such as so called `genius education.` In addition to providing special education for gifted children, it also seeks to turn ordinary children into intellectual over-achievers through constant stimulation from a very early age, often through very direct maternal participation. In other words, children under 5 or 6 year olds may already know how to play several musical instruments, have advanced math and communication skills, and be able to speak one or more foreign languages.

But this approach also has its shortcomings. For one thing, long-term studies seem to show that whatever advantage these forced prodigies may have over their ordinary classmates tends to disappear within a few years of entering school, and the education gap narrows considerably - unless active, prolonged stimulation is continued. But this development merely underlines what many see as the program's more serious problem: children who are under heavy pressure to study against their will are apt to suffer from depression and have difficulty adjusting to their peers. In the long run, the concern is that they may turn into bright but maladjusted adults who can never find happiness or satisfaction.

# Closing

I don't know how to close this write. I just want to share a letter from a man imprisoned on suspicion of murder his mother when he was a high school student. Someday he sent a letter to his friend and it was made public.

Parents say `look far away` but School parents say `look ahead`.
Parents say `go together` but School parents say `go first`.
Parents say `dream you dream` but School parents don't give them any time to dream.
