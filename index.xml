      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never had dreamed to become a police officer before. But some events made me challenge becoming a police officer.
When I made my mind, the plan of the state examination to the police officer this year was not yet opened until that time. Even though having no information, I could assume what I&amp;rsquo;m needed with the recruitment notice from maritime police which had been anounced in advance.
According to the announcement, I was not qualified because I did not have the certificate of Engineer Information Processing(EIP) required.</description>
