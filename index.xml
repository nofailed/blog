      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t think watching TV is not that educational. It requires no effort, and people don&amp;rsquo;t have to exercise their imagination, because TV swiftly shows what comes next. People become stereotyped and uniform. However, some programs, documentaries for example, give opportunities to explore new worlds, broadening our experience and giving us the chance to think.
A lot of people in modern society are hooked on TV. The idiot box has become a &amp;ldquo;third parent&amp;rdquo; to our children and a &amp;ldquo;second spouse&amp;rdquo; to our wives and husbands.</description>

      <description>Challenge for being a police officer #2 Continuing from the last diary about my challenge for becoming a police officer, I passed the practical test of the certificate. This means that eventually, I&amp;rsquo;m qualified to apply for the job posting of a police officer. Though qualified with the EIP certificate, I also needed to take more tests to get extra points which will be helpful for the competition of career recruitment because I had nothing to get the additional points until that time.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never had dreamed to become a police officer before. But there were some events that made me to challenge becoming police officer.
When I made my mind, the plan of the state examination to the police officer this year was not yet opened until that time. Even though having no information, I could assume what I&amp;rsquo;m needed with the recruitment notice from maritime police which had been anounced in advance.</description>
