      <description>Introduction I can assume that you guys already know about the Guinness Book and what it does. As everyone in the world already knows, it is a special book to list up world best records. Personally speaking, if I have a my own record on the book, it would be not only great honor to me but also an honor to my family too.
With this essay, I would like to share the fun history of the book which perhaps you never won&amp;rsquo;t to search or might not to know forever since that is just trivial thing.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t think watching TV is not that educational. It requires no effort, and people don&amp;rsquo;t have to exercise their imagination, because TV swiftly shows what comes next. People become stereotyped and uniform. However, some programs, documentaries for example, give opportunities to explore new worlds, broadening our experience and giving us the chance to think.
A lot of people in modern society are hooked on TV. The idiot box has become a &amp;ldquo;third parent&amp;rdquo; to our children and a &amp;ldquo;second spouse&amp;rdquo; to our wives and husbands.</description>
