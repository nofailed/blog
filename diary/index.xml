      <description>Challenge for being a police officer #2 Continuing from the last diary about my challenge for becoming a police officer, I passed the practical test of the certificate. This means that eventually, I&amp;rsquo;m qualified to apply for the job posting of a police officer. Though qualified with the EIP certificate, I also needed to take more tests to get extra points which will be helpful for the competition of career recruitment because I had nothing to get the additional points until that time.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never had dreamed to become a police officer before. But there were some events that made me to challenge becoming police officer.
When I made my mind, the plan of the state examination to the police officer this year was not yet opened until that time. Even though having no information, I could assume what I&amp;rsquo;m needed with the recruitment notice from maritime police which had been anounced in advance.</description>
